TwentyFortyEight

This is a Sprite Kit based clone of [Gabriele Cirulli's awesome 2048 game][2048]. It runs on both Mac and iOS. It was originally written in Objective-C; the "swiftig" branch contains an in-progress port to Swift 2.3

The game elements have a fun "classic Mac OS" theme using black-and-white patterns from MacPaint.
