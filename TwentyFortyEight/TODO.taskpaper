- Convert dictionary-based moves to data class.
- Make a helper method -[NSArray TFEObjectsAtOrderedIndexes:(const NSUInteger *)count:(NSUInteger)] to use for initializing rowNodes in moveNodesInDirection @maybe
- Tests are obsolete with changes to TFE module's interface. Should also test that move descriptions are correct.
- Prefix TFE module functions.
- Make it more likely that a 2 is generated (chance is 90% in original version)
- Implement scoring
